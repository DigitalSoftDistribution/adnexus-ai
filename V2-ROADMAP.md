# AdNexus AI — Comprehensive V2 API & Architecture Plan

> **Version:** 2.0.0-draft  
> **Date:** 2026-05-29  
> **Status:** Foundation complete — ready for v2 implementation  
> **Branch:** `main` (`feat/v2-redesign` fully merged)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The AdNexus AI platform currently has **~166 v1 API endpoints** spread across 24 route files using a legacy Express pattern. The v2 Clean Architecture layer has only **3 route files** with ~8 endpoints. This plan defines the complete v2 migration strategy: which routes to migrate, which to consolidate, and which new capabilities to add.

### Current State
| Layer | Route Files | Endpoints | Architecture | Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| v1 (legacy) | 24 | ~166 | Express handlers, direct DB access | Full feature coverage |
| v2 (clean) | 3 | ~8 | Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Interface | Only campaigns + drafts |
| Web (Next.js) | 15 pages | 15 routes | App Router, dashboard-focused | 6 are placeholders |

### Target State
| Layer | Route Files | Endpoints | Architecture |
|-------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| v2 (clean) | 18 | ~140 | Full Clean Architecture + OpenAPI |
| v1 (legacy) | 6 | ~26 | Auth, webhooks, OAuth (stable, low-change) |
| Web (Next.js) | 22+ pages | 22+ routes | Complete feature coverage |

## 2. V2 Route Architecture

### 2.1 Design Principles

1. **Resource-oriented URLs** — `/api/v2/{resource}/{id}/{sub-resource}`
2. **Consistent response envelope** — `{ success: boolean, data?: T, error?: { code, message, details } }`
3. **Typed controllers** — `asyncHandler<AuthenticatedRequest>` for all authenticated routes
4. **Zod validation** — Request/response schemas with OpenAPI generation
5. **RBAC middleware** — `requireRole('owner', 'admin', 'editor', 'viewer')`
6. **Audit logging** — Every mutating operation logged via `IAuditLogger`
7. **Event-driven** — Domain events published via `IEventBus`

## 7. Technical Decisions

### 7.1 Keep v1 For
- **Stripe webhooks** — Must remain stable, signature verification
- **Meta/Google OAuth callbacks** — Complex flow, low change frequency
- **Platform webhooks** (Meta, Google, TikTok, Snap) — Signature-based, security-critical
- **Auth endpoints** — Battle-tested, high security requirements

### 7.2 Migrate to v2
- All CRUD operations on business entities (campaigns, drafts, audiences, reports, alerts)
- All dashboard data endpoints (summary, insights, analytics)
- All user-facing configuration (settings, billing, team)
- All AI Agent interactions

### 7.3 New in v2
- **Batch operations** — `POST /campaigns/batch-update`, `POST /campaigns/batch-delete`
- **Real-time subscriptions** — WebSocket events for live updates
- **Advanced filtering** — `GET /campaigns?filter=status:active,platform:meta`
- **Field selection** — `GET /campaigns?fields=id,name,status,spend`
- **Cursor pagination** — Replace offset with cursor for large datasets
- **Rate limit headers** — `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`
- **ETag support** — Conditional requests for caching
- **Bulk exports** — Async export jobs with webhook notification

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (per use case)
- Happy path
- Validation errors
- Permission denied
- Not found
- Repository failure
- Event bus failure

### Integration Tests (per route)
- Authentication required
- RBAC enforcement
- Request validation
- Response shape
- Error handling
- Rate limiting

### E2E Tests (critical flows)
- Sign up → Create workspace → Connect Meta → Create campaign
- AI generates draft → Approve draft → Campaign updated
- Upgrade plan → Billing webhook → Credits updated
- Alert triggered → Notification sent → User views alert

---

## 9. Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- Request count by endpoint
- Response time P50/P95/P99
- Error rate by endpoint
- Rate limit hits
- Cache hit/miss ratio

### Logging
- Structured JSON logs
- Request ID propagation
- Sensitive data redaction
- Performance timing

### Alerting
- Error rate > 1%
- P95 latency > 500ms
- 5xx rate > 0.1%
- Rate limit exhaustion

## 11. Research Findings (2026-05-29)

### 11.1 v1 API Route Catalog

**24 legacy route files** under `apps/api/src/routes/`:

| File | Mount | Endpoints | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| `auth.ts` | `/api/v1/auth` | 9 | signup, signin, refresh, me, reset-password, change-password, invite, accept-invite, signout |
| `auth/meta.ts` | `/api/v1/auth/meta` | 3 | Meta OAuth connect, callback, disconnect |
| `auth/google.ts` | `/api/v1/auth/google` | 2 | Google OAuth connect, callback |
| `campaigns.ts` | `/api/v1/campaigns` | 10 | list, summary, detail, create, update, delete, pause, resume, duplicate, insights |
| `ads.ts` | `/api/v1/ads` | 9 | list, detail, create, update, pause, resume, duplicate, performance, creative-performance |
| `drafts.ts` | `/api/v1/drafts` | 8 | list, stats, detail, create, approve, reject, cancel, schedule |
| `agent.ts` | `/api/v1/agent` | 16 | status, rules CRUD, toggle, logs, insights, recommendations, execute, creative-fatigue, pause, resume, morning-brief, run-now |
| `reports.ts` | `/api/v1/reports` | 13 | templates, dashboard, generate, scheduled CRUD, saved CRUD, export, cross-platform, funnel |
| `audiences.ts` | `/api/v1/audiences` | 5 | list, detail, performance, overlap, suggestions |
| `settings.ts` | `/api/v1/settings` | 14 | workspace CRUD, accounts, team CRUD, billing, notifications, AI settings |
| `notifications.ts` | `/api/v1/notifications` | 8 | inbox, unread-count, mark read, read-all, delete, preferences, test |
| `billing.ts` | `/api/v1/billing` | 5 | plan, checkout, portal, webhook, invoices |
| `goals.ts` | `/api/v1/goals` | 5 | CRUD + progress |
| `exports.ts` | `/api/v1/exports` | 9 | CSV, XLSX, PDF, streaming, queued jobs |
| `search.ts` | `/api/v1/search` | 9 | global, campaigns, adsets, ads, drafts, audit, suggestions, recent |
| `webhooks.ts` | `/api/v1/webhooks` | 7 | inbound receivers (meta, google, tiktok, snap, custom, register, verification) |
| `webhooks-config.ts` | `/api/v1/webhooks` | 6 | config CRUD, test, deliveries |
| `audit-log.ts` | `/api/v1/audit-log` | 4 | list, detail, export, stats |
| `admin.ts` | `/api/v1/admin` | 7 | stats, users, workspaces, errors, api-usage, feature-flags |
| `api-keys.ts` | `/api/v1/api-keys` | 4 | list, create, revoke, stats |
| `comments.ts` | `/api/v1/comments` | 3 | draft comments, create, delete |
| `upload.ts` | `/api/v1/upload` | 5 | upload, list, detail, delete, patch |
| `alerts.ts` | `/api/v1/alerts` | 9 | CRUD, toggle, test, history, stats |
| `public-audit.ts` | `/api/v1/public` | 1 | unauthenticated audit endpoint |

**Known v1 Issues:**
- `/api/v1/reports/cross-platform` and `/funnel` declared AFTER `/:id` — may be shadowed
- `/api/v1/audiences/overlap` and `/suggestions` declared AFTER `/:id` — may be shadowed
- `/api/v1/webhooks` mount collision: receiver routes (before auth) vs config routes (after auth)
- `/api/v1/comments/comments/:id` has redundant path segment
- `/api/v1/upload/upload` and `/uploads` have repeated wording
